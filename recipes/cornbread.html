        <p>What to bring to a cookout is always a tough call. 
            Ribs or brisket would be great, but they’re not cheap, and take hours to prepare. 
            On the other end of the spectrum, you could just bring a bag of chips, but that’s kind of weak sauce.
            In fact, that’s probably worse that literally bringing a weak sauce, which is why this easy-to-make cast iron cornbread is such a great option. 
            This stuff is very inexpensive to make, but that’ll be the last thing anyone will be thinking about as they eat, and if everything goes according to plan, you’ll be asked to bring it to the next gathering. 
            Sure, every once in a while it would be nice to show up with a pulled pork shoulder, but hey, you’re the cornbread guy or gal, and that’s just your thing.
